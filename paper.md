# Summary

OncoPrint, the plot to visualize an overview of genetic variants in sequencing
data, has been widely used in the field of cancer genomics. However, still,
there have been no libraries capable to generate OncoPrint written in Python yet,
which is a big hassle to plot OncoPrints within a Python-based genetic variants
analysis pipeline. This paper introduces a new Python package `PyOncoPrint`,
which can be easily used to plot OncoPrints in Python. The package is based on
the existing widely used scientific plotting library `Matplotlib`, the resulting
plots are easy to be modified for various needs.

# Statement of need

Since 2012, cBioPortal[@cerami2012cbio;@gao2013integrative] has provided extensive
cancer genomics data. The plots to visualize an overview of the genetic variants
in the deposited data, which is named `OncoPrint`, become popular especially in
the field of cancer genomics. Although the official Github repository of
cBioPortal provides a
[JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/cBioPortal/oncoprintjs), also there
have been an R implementation [@gu2016complex] to plot OncoPrints, still, there have
been no Python implementations so far.

`PyOncoPrint` is a Python package for plotting OncoPrints in Python. The package
is mainly based on `Matplotlib`[@hunter2007matplotlib], therefore the details of
plots, for example, the plot size, title, background colors, etc. can be easily
modified, thus can be easily adapted to the various scenario. `PyOncoPrint` supports
all scatter plot markers available in the `Matplotlib` package, as well as custom
markers defined by polygon coordinates. `PyOncoPrint` is also capable to
automatically sort the samples and genes by the frequency of each genetic variant,
so that one can easily overview the plotted genetic variants, and ready-to-be used
as a figure in a paper (\autoref{fig:example}). The genetic variation data can
be easily imported using Python package `Pandas`[@mckinney2011pandas], as well as
the CSV files exported from `cBioPortal` can be directly imported as an input.
